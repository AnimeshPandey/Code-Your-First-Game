# Code Your First Game : Arcade Classic in JavaScript on Canvas
## This is a repository for the Udemy course, Code Your First Game : Arcade Classic in JavaScript on Canvas, instructed by Chris DeLeon.

### Objectives

* Learn design from a fun classic that people know and enjoy.
* Start your practice today – now! – without waiting for an idea.
* Finish your game in hours or in a weekend, not over months.
* Understand every line of code used in the entire program.
* Avoid distraction from searching for or creating detailed art.
* Master fundamentals needed to make your own games better.
* You can program this game with a normal text editor, and run it in the web browser you already have. No special software is needed.

Though you'll be coding in JavaScript for HTML5 canvas in this course, the focus is on common game programming concepts. You can later apply these same patterns to get quick results in other programming languages such as C#, Java, ActionScript 3, C++, or Python.


### What am I going to get from this course?

* Display, position, and move filled shapes for retro and prototype gameplay
* Move a ball around your game space such that it bounces off boundaries
* Handle real-time mouse input
* Detect and respond to simple collisions
* Program very basic artificial intelligence
* Keep and display score during play
* Understand the subtle, key difference between a classic game in this style which is fun to play versus one that isn't
* Define and code a win condition and end state for your game

### Target audience?

This is for anyone who wants a quick but thorough introduction to simple game programming in a way that doesn't require any special software, download, or installation.
If you've had at least a little exposure to generic programming concepts like variables, functions, and if-statements you'll have an advantage, however in case you've never heard those terms they're explained briefly as they come up.
Although this a uses JavaScript and HTML5, it is not intended for someone who is focused on learning HTML5/JS for web page design.
